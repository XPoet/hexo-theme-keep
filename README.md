## :rocket: Installation

If you're using Hexo 5.0 or later, the simplest way to install is through npm:

```sh
$ cd hexo-site
$ npm install hexo-theme-keep
```

Or you can clone the entire repository:

```sh
$ cd hexo-site
$ git clone https://github.com/XPoet/hexo-theme-keep themes/keep
```

After the installation, open Hexo config file and set `theme` variable to `keep`.

```yml
theme: keep
```

## :wrench: Configuration

Refer to the [Keep theme configuration guide](https://keep.xpoet.cn/2020/10/Keep-主题配置指南/).

It is not recommended to directly modify any files in the «Keep» theme. Because this may cause errors (e.g. merge conflicts), and the modified files may be discarded when upgrading the theme.

However, you can bypass merge conflicts (error message like **«Commit your changes or stash them before you can merge»**) by using the `Commit`, `Stash` or `Reset` commands for local changes. See [here](https://stackoverflow.com/a/15745424/5861495) how to do it.

## :dart: Update

«Keep» releases new versions from time to time. You can update Keep by the following command.

Install the latest version throuth npm:

```sh
$ cd hexo-site
$ npm update hexo-theme-keep
```

Or update to latest master branch:

```sh
$ cd themes/keep
$ git pull
```
