If you're using Hexo 5.0 or later, the simplest way to install is through NPM:

npm install hexo-theme-keep
```

Or you can clone the entire repository:

```sh
cd your-hexo
git clone https://github.com/XPoet/hexo-theme-keep --depth=1 themes/keep
```

After the installation, open Hexo config file and set `theme` variable to `keep`.

```yml
theme: keep
```

## :tada: Update

**Keep** releases new versions from time to time. You can update **Keep** by the following command.

Install the latest version through NPM:

```sh
# recommend

cd your-hexo
npm install hexo-theme-keep@latest
```

Or update to the latest master branch:

```sh
cd themes/keep
git pull
```

It is not recommended to directly modify any files in the **Keep** theme. Because this may cause errors (e.g. merge conflicts), and the modified files may be discarded when upgrading the theme.
